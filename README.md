# Binary Radix Sort

This C++ program implements Binary Radix Sort, a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm. It reads a list of unsigned integers from a file, performs the Binary Radix Sort algorithm, and writes the sorted list to an output file.

## Usage

### Compilation

```
g++ main.cpp -o binary_radix_sort
```

### Execution
```
./binary_radix_sort <input_filename>
```

**Example:**
```
Input:
8 5 12 3 7 1

Output:
1 3 5 7 8 12
```

### Notes
- The program assumes valid input files with correct unsigned integer data.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read from and write to files.
